Display custom selected photos, videos or feeds from an Instagram account with ease in a simple, elegant, responsive layout.

== Description ==

**Why Use Insertagram?** The key ingredient (separation from all the other **Instagram** plugins) is the capability to choose **photos** or **videos** to insert one at a time or by groups. Insertagram also has the capability to display feeds from an **Instagram** account.

**How Does it Look?** The image display is simple, crisp, elegant, and **responsive**. In viewing the embedded **Instagram** photos on posts and pages, the user can hover over and see the **Instagram** profile pic, caption, like count, comment count... and click to open the **Instagram** page in a new tab of the browser.

**How Do I Manage It?** Use the 'Insertagram +' link in the left nav to generate shortcodes by selecting the images you'd like to post... or use the shortcode to display a recent feed from an **Instagram** account.

See a demo [here](http://insertagram.hensonism.com "here").

= Features =

== Installation ==

1. Install the **Instagram** plugin either via the WordPress plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your web server (in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to the 'Insertagram' settings page to obtain your **Instagram** Access Token and User ID.
4. Create custom shortcodes by clicking on the 'Insertagram +' link in the left nav or use the shortcode `[insertagram feed=true]` to display a real-time feed of your recent **Instagram** posts - in any page or post.

= Shortcode Options =
* **id** - A unique ID generated when creating a custom shortcode via the 'Insertagram +' left nav link. This ID will be generated for you - after selecting image/s - Example: `[insertagram id=1234]`
* **feed** - If true - this option will display a real-time feed of most recent posts. This option should not exist with the `id` option - Example: `[insertagram feed=true]`
* **info** - If false - all info including comment count, like count, caption, and profile pic will be hidden. This is true by default. - Example: `[insertagram id=1234 info=false]`
